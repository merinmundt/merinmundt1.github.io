        <p>
          I am a senior at Iowa State graduating in May of 2020. I am looking for a job in the web programming
          and software development fields. I have kept up my gpa at a 3.4 while being a full time athlete and full time
          student. I am on the Iowa State University soccer team which takes up 20 hours/week.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am a smart, dedicated student who is always looking to learn and improve my knowledge. I have made the
          Dean's List 4 of the 6
          semesters I have participated in, and hope to again this semester.
